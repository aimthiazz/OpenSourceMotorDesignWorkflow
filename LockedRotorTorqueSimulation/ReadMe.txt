Simulated Locked Rotor Torque for different current values

Run : LockedRotorTorqueSimulation.py to setup the problem and run the simulation

Individual Torque Plots and Data are stored in Plots and ExcelResults folder respectively

This simulation is setup as multiprocessing. i.e. Multiple instance of FEMM (Different Current Instances) are run in parallel to reduce simulation time.

Achieved 4x Simulation time reduction by multiprocessing
